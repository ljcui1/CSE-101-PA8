## Makefile
> This make file is a script used to compile the c++ codes and check the executable file.

## Order.cpp
> This c++ file contains code that reads an input file and builds a tree based off of the input info. Various string representations of the dictionary/tree are outputted. The input and output system base is from Patrick Tantalo's FileIO code.

## WordFrequency.cpp
> This c++ file contains code that reads an input file and builds a tree based off of the input info. Individual parsed words will be converted to lower case and placed by its key in the Dictionary. Output will avoid repeated works. The input and output system base is from Patrick Tantalo's FileIO code.

## Dictionary.cpp
> This c++ file contains code that builds the Dictionary ADT in the form of a Red Black Tree with a current iteration value. The file contains constructor and destructor functions as well as various access and manipulation functions. Operators are also overloaded in this file.

## Dictionary.h
> This is the header file containing the functions from Dictionary.cpp.

## DictionaryTest.cpp
> This c++ file contains code used to test the functionality of every function in the Dictionary.cpp file. The test code and format base is from Patrick Tantalo's DictionaryClient code.
